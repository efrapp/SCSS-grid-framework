              THE ROAD TO ENLIGHTENMENT
          </h2>
          <p>
              Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags,
              incompatible DOMs, broken CSS support, and abandoned browsers.
          </p>
          <p>
              We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks
              to the tireless efforts of folk like the W3C, WASP, and the major browser creators.

              SO WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?
          </h2>
          <p>
              There is a continuing need to show the power of CSS. The Zen Garden aims to excite,
              inspire, and encourage participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs in the list.
              Clicking on any one will load the style sheet into this very page. The HTML remains the same,
              the only thing that has changed is the external CSS file. Yes, really.

                    Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying this page,
                    so strong CSS skills are necessary too, but the example files are commented
                    well enough that even CSS novices can use them as starting points. Please see
                    the CSS Resource Guide for advanced tutorials and tips on working with CSS.

                    REQUIREMENTS
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Where possible, we would like to see mostly CSS 1 & 2 usage. CSS 3 & 4 should be
                    limited to widely-supported elements only, or strong fallbacks should be provided.
                    The CSS Zen Garden is about functional, practical CSS and not the latest bleeding-edge
                    tricks viewable by 2% of the browsing public. The only real requirement we have is that
                    your CSS validates.
